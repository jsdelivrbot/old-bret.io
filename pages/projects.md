Projects
===========

This is a list of personal projects from the past few years.  I am still putting the page together, so [send a PR](https://github.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io/blob/master/pages/projects.md) if you spot an error anywhere!  There are lots of pictures so that its more interesting to browse.  Feel free to let me know if you would like any more info on any of these topics.

##[SEMterface](/pages/projects/semterface) (2013 - Present)
* SEMterface aims to put a Scanning Electron Microscope onto the Internet using [websockets](http://socket.io), [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org) and [node](http://nodejs.org/) for great good and earn me a masters degree in applied physics.
* I presented the project at WebRTC Camp 2013 in Portland. Check out the [slide deck](/2013/10/19/t1).

##[This website](/pages/projects/this-website) (2012 - Present)
* This website has turned into somewhat of a project itself.  It's built with jekyll and incorporates some [indieweb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) building blocks.  The next version is built with node and is in active development.

##[Personal VPS/Cloud](/pages/projects/vps)
* Having a computer that is always on and perpetually connected to the Internet opens up a lot of possibilities and turns out to be a lot of fun.  Some services that can run on such a personal server are more useful than others, and these are some notes on my experience with a variety of tools.

##[Webmention.js (2013)](https://github.com/bcomnes/webmention.js)
* This small client side javascript library makes it easy to display webmentions and pingback data from the [webmention.io](http://webmention.io/) service.

##[Homework Template (2012 - 2013)](https://github.com/bcomnes/hw-template)
* Having the right packages and templates can make the difference between hating and loving LaTeX.  This collection makes writing Quantum Mechanics and E&M homework a bit quicker and neater.

##[LaTeX Font Sizing in TextMate 2](https://github.com/bcomnes/LaTeX-Section-Font-Sizes.tmbundle)
* A small bundle that resizes the section names in LaTeX documents so that they are easier and faster to identify.

## [Resume](/media/Bret_Comnes_CV.pdf)
* My resume typeset in LaTeX and tracked on [github](https://github.com/bcomnes/Resume).
* Check out the comments in the [.tex](https://github.com/bcomnes/Resume/blob/public/resume.tex) file for more details.
* LaTeX is great when it comes to printing Resumes but I woudl prefer an HTML version at this point.  Maybe its time for pandoc.

## [Mathematica Notebooks](/pages/projects/mathematica)
Implementing and visualizing different concepts from topics in physics was a great way to learn.  Here some of the more interesting results of doing this.

## Introductory Physics Labs
These two labs and LabVIEW design patterns were written for an introductory electronics class at Portland State University.  Some of the labs were written in .DOCX format at the request of the instructor.  It would be fantastic to turn these into HTML at some point.

- [Microcontroller Lab](https://github.com/bcomnes/315-lab-microcontroller) -  This lab introduces students to microcontrollers by walking them through a variety of activities using the Arduino Microcontroller.  It also includes an additional section on use of the [PID](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIDLibrary) Arduino library.

- [FPGA Lab](https://github.com/bcomnes/fpga-lab) - This lab introduces [FPGAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) using the Digilent Nexys 3 FPGA and the Xilinx ISE IDE.  Students use both component level FPGA design and the VHDL hardware description language.

- [LabVIEW Examples](https://github.com/bcomnes/labview-tutorials) - A collection of common design patterns in LabVIEW that are helpful while teaching others.

## [Gravity Research](/pages/projects/gravlab)
I helped develop an experiment aimed to observe the fundamental nature of Gravity at the Humboldt State University Gravitational Research Lab.

## Senior Labs
One week to work on a lab and write it up.  Here are the (raw)results from this process.  Given the time constraints, most reports received only a single draft.

## [445nm Lasers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157624743491759/)
After finding out about the new 445nm laser diodes coming onto the market, it seemed like a good idea to build a small portable version for some reason.  Also, [Laser van Beethoven!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157627143764172/)

## [Arduino Microserver](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157627731812031/)
Back when the Arduino Ethernet shield was first released, I spent some time playing around with an early version of the Arduino Micro Server library.  It was a great way to learn about how web servers work and let random people from IRC spam light switches in your house.

## [Longhaul Trucker](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157627731825277/)
I was gifted a brand new bicycle after graduating college and ended up with a Surly Long Haul Trucker (Thank Mom and Dad!).  I was also living a and working in Arcata at the time and went a bit overboard on the [Velo Orange](http://www.velo-orange.com) and [Walnut Studiolo](http://walnutstudiolo.com) website.

## [Discovering Galaxies at NAIC Arecibo Observatory](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/72157640257583256/)
I helped discover previously uncharted galaxies at the [NAIC Arecibo Observatory](http://www.naic.edu/) through the [Alfalfa](http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/index.php/) sky survey.  We ran five nights of a general sky survey looking at 21cm radiation.  Hydrogen has a small chance of a spin flip which results in an emission in this spectrum.  Galaxies made up of hydrogen give off a fair amount of 21cm radiation allowing detection.  This allowed us to identify 'Dark' galaxies that contain hydrogen, even if they are not emitting any light.

## [Photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/)
I liked taking pictures, but sadly, my camera fell and broke in 2011, so I'm stuck shooting with a cell phone.  Also, flickr is really starting to be awful.  The title links to flickr sets, but feel free to [check out the firehose](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bretc/sets/).

## Music Stuff and Radio
I have some fun musical equipment and ran a College radio show at one point, but its hard to find the time/physical space for it.  My family does better music that I do though:

* [Lucia](http://www.luciacomnes.com/) (My Sister)
* [Brian](https://soundcloud.com/baghead) (aka Dad)
* [#music](http://bret.io/pages/tags/#Music)
